Couple of things to follow for the smooth running of the code.

* Please start the launch of the website by running the mainpage. This is treated as the login page. So all the storage variable is cleared and rest if this is the first page to be launched. if any other page is launched, there might be some issues.
* Also, please input the name of the products in the pages Snacks and Candies exactly as their names are displayed as it checks that no number is inputted (which is required) and is not case-sensitive.
* There is a logout button that clears the localstorage and goes back to the mainpage.
