            <h1>About us</h1>
            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p> Every day we open our doors and welcome millions of hungry people. But they are not just hungry for food. They are hungry for something that can make their lives healthier, easier, brighter and a bit lighter. They are hungry to feel good, do well, to go from anxiety to inspiration.
                So whether we manufacture, market, stock, check, deliver, or manage, we all try to make their experience as uplifting as possible. We&apos;ve always been about value, convenience, and making customers&apos; lives simpler.
                To lift them up, we keep our hands, hearts and minds open so we can be attentive to their needs and provide true hospitality and generosity. Because every time someone crosses our threshold we get a fresh chance to make an emotional connection, lighten their load and lift them up.
                It is a simple truth that our world is hungry for uplift. It&apos;s a universal need, as powerful as our need for food or fuel.
                That&apos;s why our Purpose is To Feed the Human Spirit.
